# HRO_SummerResearch2018

This is one of the main project I did over the summer of 2018 at Villanova University under the guidance of Dr. David Chuss, a physicw professor at Villanova University. In this project,

1. Used Pythonâ€™s package like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data from four different
intensity bands of different wavelength from Orion Nebula.
2. Created histogram of relative orientation between the magnetic field and the intensity gradient to
see their alignment at different locations in Orion Nebula.

Orion nebula is one of the most studied nebula in Astronomy and physics. If you want to learn more about the nebula, follow the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula.
